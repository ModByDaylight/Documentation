## Prerequisites

- [Project Setup](../../../Development/UnrealEngine/ProjectSetup.md)
- [Procedural Level Generation](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/917649484450775061/940370562751029338/ProceduralLevelGeneration.zip)
- [Asset Registry Helper](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/877980209083723797/908631102703403018/AssetRegistryHelper.zip)

## Required Setup

Download the Procedural Level Generation files. Unzip `ProceduralLevelGeneration.zip` into your project's `[ProjectName]/Content` folder. This will allow you to create and edit tiled maps.

## Creating Tiled Maps

1. Navigate to `/Content/ProceduralLevelGeneration/TiledMaps/Completed` and right click to create a new tile map asset in one of the existing realm subdirectories. You can rename this tile map to whatever you want.
