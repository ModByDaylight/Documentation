# Meshes

**What is the difference between a static and skeletal mesh?**

A static mesh is an object with no skeleton that does not have any animations. It is permanently stuck in one pose.
A skeletal mesh is an object with a skeleton that has weights, bones, etc. Typically these come with animations and aren't bound to one pose.

Static Mesh. Can be identified in the Class section.
