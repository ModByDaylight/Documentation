# Unreal Engine

Dead By Daylight uses Unreal Engine 4.25.4 as its Game Engine.
UE4 provides a solid framework for developing fast executing native code and an interface for artists to use an easier way for creating content.

In this section we go over some minor basics you should know.

!!! warning

    This does not replace the [Unreal Engine Documentation](https://docs.unrealengine.com/).

    Even if we make mods and not a standalone game, most of the stuff you will need to use is not stuff from Dead By Daylight, it will be actually from the Unreal Engine. That means we highly recommend you to go through some Unreal Engine tutorials and try to make such a tutorial game. The process creating the content is nearly the same!
