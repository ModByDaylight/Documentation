# Development

If you'd like to make your own mod, this section of the docs is for you!

Here you can find information regarding making mods and getting your development environment up and running. Check out the subcategories on the left to get started.

If you're just looking to play Dead By Daylight with mods, check out how to install mods [here](../PrivateServer/ModInstallation.md) instead.
